# Anagrams

An off-the-top-of-my-head implementation of an anagram solver using a trie tree in Objective-C.

This is a quick and dirty first pass so I have a jumping off point to learn Swift. The project features a few things to make learning swift more engaging than just a "Hello World" application such as a linked tree and async queues.

The important things are the models. The view controllers are just to make it usable.
